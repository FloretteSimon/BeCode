The mission
Pentesting is an activity that will ask you to perform security tests. Those tests must be legally framed in order to protect you. At each step of your pentest you must ask yourself if the action you're doing has been approved by the right person in the company.

Your mission will be to define workflows and templates of paper that you would use to conduct professional pentest. I know, it's not the most exiting part of pentesting but you need to protect yourself before acquiring legally punishable knowledges.

Instructions
As stated above I will ask you to produce workflows of how you would conduct a pentesting.

Here are some questions that you should ask yourself :

What are the steps of a standard pentest?
Who are the people i'll be in contact with? What are their job titles? Are they "IT-minded"?
What is the outcome of a pentest?
What are the metrics that will be used to assess the pentest report?
Some attention points :

Timing
Test impact on business
Risk indicators
Commercialy speaking, providing a quote for each vuln fix might be a good idea
The result should be structured the following way :

"Pentest Agreement"
"Workflow Communication Schematics"
"Pentest Report Agreement"
Feel free to add any extension that you judge useful
The documents presented must look professional and must be reusable for different clients/pentests.

The goal here is to make you understand how to setup a lawful frame around your test procedure. It might be interesting for you to keep your results to reuse them once you start your pentester activity.

The results will be presented at a general debrief.

# Result:

## "Pentest Agreement":
Purpose: Establishes the legal framework, scope, and terms of the pentest engagement.

Components:

1. INTRODUCTION:

  -  Overview of the pentest purpose and objectives.
  -  Legal disclaimer outlining the boundaries of authorized testing.
    

2. SCOPE OF WORK:

 - Detailed description of systems, networks, and applications to be tested.
 - Specific testing methodologies and techniques to be employed.
 - Exclusions and limitations (e.g., systems not to be tested).


3. AUTHORIZATION:

   - Confirmation that the client has legal authority over the systems being tested.
   - Permission to conduct tests and attempt exploitation under defined conditions.


4. RESPONSIBILITIES:
   
 - Roles and responsibilities of the pentester and the client's team.
 - Confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements.


5. TIMELINE:

   - Start and end dates of the pentest.
   - Milestones and deliverables schedule.
     

6. LEGAL COMPLIANCE:

   - Adherence to relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS).
   - Indemnification clauses to protect both parties.

## "Workflow Communication Schematics"
Purpose: Provides a structured outline of communication and steps throughout the pentest process.

Stages:

1. PRE-ENGAGEMENT:

   - Initial scoping meeting with client stakeholders.
   - Agreement on pentest objectives, scope, and methodology.
   - Legal review and signing of the Pentest Agreement.
  

2. INFORMATION GATHERING:

   - Collection of publicly available information (OSINT: refers to the collection and analysis of information gathered from publicly available sources to understand and assess potential security risks or vulnerabilities).
   - Permission-based scanning and reconnaissance activities.


3. VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT:

   - Active and passive scanning for vulnerabilities.
   - Identification and classification of vulnerabilities
     

4. EXPLOITATION AND TESTING:

   - Controlled exploitation to verify vulnerabilities (if authorized).
   - Monitoring and documenting test impacts on systems and business operations.


5. POST-EXPLOITATION ANALISIS:

   - Further exploration to assess potential for further exploitation.
   - Documentation of findings and proof-of-concept evidence.


6. REPORTING PREPARATION:

   - Drafting of the pentest report including findings, risks, and recommendations.
   - Review with internal team for accuracy and completeness.
  
7. CLIENT DEBRIEF:

   - Presentation of findings to client stakeholders.
   - Discussion of remediation strategies and timelines.

## "Pentest Report Agreement"
Purpose: Defines the structure, content, and delivery expectations for the final pentest report.

Contents:

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY:

   - Summary of findings, critical vulnerabilities, and overall risk assessment.


2. DETAILED FINDINGS:

   - Comprehensive listing of vulnerabilities discovered during testing.
   - Technical details including severity, exploitability, and impact.


3. RISK ASSESSMENT:

   - Prioritized list of vulnerabilities based on risk metrics (e.g., CVSS scores).
   - Recommendations for mitigation and remediation.


4. RECOMMENDATIONS:

   - Actionable steps and best practices for improving security posture.
   - Commercially viable quotes for fixing identified vulnerabilities (optional).


5. APPENDICES:

   - Supporting documentation such as raw scan results, screenshots, and proof-of-concept code.

## Additional Considerations

- Timing: Adhere to agreed-upon timelines to avoid disruption to business operations and to maintain professionalism.
  
- Test Impact on Business: Minimize disruption by coordinating test activities during off-peak hours and communicating with relevant IT and business stakeholders.
  
- Risk Indicators: Use standardized metrics (e.g., CVSS) to objectively assess and communicate the severity of vulnerabilities.
  
- Commercial Aspects: Optionally, provide cost estimates or quotes for fixing identified vulnerabilities to assist clients in budgeting and prioritizing remediation efforts.
