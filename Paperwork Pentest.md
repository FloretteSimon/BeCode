The mission
Pentesting is an activity that will ask you to perform security tests. Those tests must be legally framed in order to protect you. At each step of your pentest you must ask yourself if the action you're doing has been approved by the right person in the company.

Your mission will be to define workflows and templates of paper that you would use to conduct professional pentest. I know, it's not the most exiting part of pentesting but you need to protect yourself before acquiring legally punishable knowledges.

Instructions
As stated above I will ask you to produce workflows of how you would conduct a pentesting.

Here are some questions that you should ask yourself :

What are the steps of a standard pentest?
Who are the people i'll be in contact with? What are their job titles? Are they "IT-minded"?
What is the outcome of a pentest?
What are the metrics that will be used to assess the pentest report?
Some attention points :

Timing
Test impact on business
Risk indicators
Commercialy speaking, providing a quote for each vuln fix might be a good idea
The result should be structured the following way :

"Pentest Agreement"
"Workflow Communication Schematics"
"Pentest Report Agreement"
Feel free to add any extension that you judge useful
The documents presented must look professional and must be reusable for different clients/pentests.

The goal here is to make you understand how to setup a lawful frame around your test procedure. It might be interesting for you to keep your results to reuse them once you start your pentester activity.

The results will be presented at a general debrief.
