# Cybersecurity in autonomous vehicles

## Advantages
1. Improving road safety:
   - Reducing accidents: Autonomous cars can significantly reduce the number of road accidents caused by human error (distraction, fatigue, drink-driving).
   - Faster reaction: Autonomous driving systems can react faster than humans, detecting and responding to hazards in a fraction of a second.
     
2. Traffic efficiency and fluidity:
   - Traffic optimisation: Autonomous cars can communicate with each other and with the road infrastructure to optimise traffic flows, reducing traffic jams.

3. Accessibility and increased mobility:
   - Mobility for all: Autonomous cars can offer greater mobility to old people, the disabled and those who cannot drive.

4. Improving crisis management:
   - Emergency response: Autonomous vehicles can be used for disaster relief missions, delivering medicines or transporting people safely without risking the lives of rescue workers.
   - Surveillance and security: They can also be used for surveillance and security, helping to prevent and respond rapidly to incidents.
